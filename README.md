# real-estate-predictions
This project will gather and process data relating to house prices. That data will be fed to different machine learning models. The best model will be chosen and implemented on a website for others to use

api_key, api_host, and rent_url get their values from a .env file that is located in the same directory as listing_data.py

There is also a venv directory that I have run these commands within:
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pandas
pip install requests
pip install python_dotenv
